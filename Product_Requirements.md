# Container Image Vulnerability Scanning Product Requirements

### Version: 1.0

## Problem Statement
Container images may have known vulnerabilities that expose them to security risks. Users need a way to scan, identify, and prioritize fixing these vulnerabilities based on severity.

## Target Audience
- DevOps Engineers

- System Administrators

## Key Features
1. **Image Scanning**: Automatically scan container images and detect vulnerabilities.
2. **Severity Classification**: Categorize vulnerabilities into Critical, High, Medium, and Low.
3. **Sorting & Filtering**: Filter by severity, image name, and number of vulnerabilities.
4. **Fix Prioritization**: Help users identify and prioritize which images to fix.
5. **Report Generation**: Downloadable reports with vulnerability details.
6. **Alerts/Notifications**: Notify users when new vulnerabilities are detected.

## User Flows
- User logs in → Navigates to the dashboard → Starts a scan → Views results → Filters vulnerabilities → Takes action.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Scanning must complete within 2 minutes for 1 image.
- Users should be able to view a report within 5 seconds after a scan.
