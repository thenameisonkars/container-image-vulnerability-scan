# Container Vulnerability Scanner - Product Requirements and Wireframes

1. Project Overview
This repository contains the product requirements and low-fidelity wireframes for a Container Image Vulnerability Scanner. The project is aimed at building a product that helps users identify and prioritize vulnerabilities in their container images, making it easier to secure applications deployed in containers.

2. Problem Statement
Container images often contain applications along with their dependencies. Some of these dependencies might have known vulnerabilities, posing a security risk. Users need to understand which container images have vulnerabilities and how severe these vulnerabilities are, so they can prioritize which images to fix first.
