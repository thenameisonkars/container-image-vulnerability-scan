# Container Image Vulnerability Scanning - Product Requirements Document

## Version: 1.0
### Date: [Insert Todayâ€™s Date]

### 1. Problem Statement
Container images may contain vulnerabilities that need to be identified and resolved to secure applications. Users require a way to scan, categorize, and prioritize fixing vulnerabilities based on severity.

### 2. Target Audience
- **DevOps Engineers**: Responsible for building and deploying applications in containers.
- **Security Analysts**: Ensuring applications are secure from known vulnerabilities.
- **System Administrators**: Maintaining and managing a secure containerized environment.

### 3. Goals and Objectives
- **Identify Vulnerabilities**: Provide a mechanism to scan and list vulnerabilities in container images.
- **Categorize by Severity**: Automatically classify vulnerabilities as Critical, High, Medium, or Low.
- **Prioritize Fixes**: Enable users to prioritize which vulnerabilities need to be fixed based on severity and criticality.
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Show actionable steps to remediate vulnerabilities.
- **Generate Reports**: Create downloadable reports for audits and compliance.

### 4. Key Features
- **Image Scanning**: Scan images for vulnerabilities and list all known issues.
- **Severity Categorization**: Each vulnerability will be categorized by severity.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Users can filter and sort images by severity, image name, and vulnerability type.
- **Fix Recommendations**: Provide automated suggestions for fixing vulnerabilities.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Notify users when new vulnerabilities are found.

### 5. User Flows
1. **User Logs In**: Authenticates and navigates to the dashboard.
2. **Dashboard View**: Shows an overview of all scanned images and their vulnerability status.
3. **Initiate a Scan**: User starts a new scan, which will automatically fetch and analyze container images.
4. **View Results**: Displays results in a table format, categorized by severity.
5. **Apply Filters**: Filter results to view only images with Critical and High vulnerabilities.
6. **View Image Details**: Click on an image to view a detailed vulnerability report.
7. **Take Action**: Fix or ignore specific vulnerabilities based on the analysis.

### 6. Acceptance Criteria
- Users should be able to initiate a scan and receive results within 5 minutes for up to 1000 images.
- Vulnerabilities should be classified by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- Users should be able to filter and view specific vulnerabilities quickly.
- Report generation should complete within 10 seconds.

### 7. Development Action Items (Bonus)
- **Backend**: Implement image scanning functionality using security tools like `Clair` or `Trivy`.
- **Frontend**: Build a simple React-based dashboard with data filtering and sorting.
- **API Integration**: Create REST APIs to fetch scan results and update vulnerabilities.
- **Notifications**: Integrate email notifications using a service like SendGrid.
- **Database**: Use MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store scan results.

### 8. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Scans should complete within a reasonable time (2-5 minutes per 1000 images).
- **Scalability**: The system should support adding new images dynamically.
- **Security**: All data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.
